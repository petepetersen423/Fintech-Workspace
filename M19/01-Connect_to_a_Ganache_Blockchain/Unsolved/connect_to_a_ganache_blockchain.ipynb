    "# Connect to a Ganache Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will use the mnemonic seed phrase that was provied by Ganache to create your HD wallet and your Ethereum public-private key pair and account address.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then use Web3.py to connect to the Ganache blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete each of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the `Unsolved` folder, create your `.env` file, which should contain the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache saved as the variable `MNEMONIC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import the necessary libraries and functions, and set Ganache as your provider by defining a variable w3 that uses the Web3 function to define the HTTPProvider as the RPC Server address provided by Ganache.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache, and the `Wallet()` class from the bip44 package, to generate a wallet instance. Then, derive your private and public keys by calling the `.derive_account` method on the `wallet` object and passing it the string “eth”. Save the two returned values as variables named `private` and `public`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pass the private-key value to `Account.privateKeyToAccount`, and save the returned `account` object as a variable named `account`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Call `account.address` and save it as a new variable named `account_address`. Then print the `account_address` variable to get your public Ethereum address from your public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the Jupyter notebook, fetch the balance of your Ethereum address by using Web3.py. To do so, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Call the `w3.eth.getBalance` method, and pass it the `account_address` variable. Save the returned value as a variable named `wei_balance`.\n",
    "   * Call the function `w3.fromWei`, and pass it your `wei_balance` variable and the string “ether”. Save the returned value as a variable named `ether`. Print your account balance in ether.\n",
