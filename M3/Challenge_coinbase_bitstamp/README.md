## Project Summary

Overall, this project is an analysis of to bitcoin trading datasets, one for coinbase and the other for bistamp. Analysis was ultimiate designed to determine the future viablity of a bitcoin arbitrage strategy.  Our conclusion is the begiining in February 2018, sophisticated algorithmic traders entered the market and eliminsated any arbitrage opputunities greater than 1%.  We thefore reccomend pursuing more technichal or valuation based research in order to determine the viability of alternative trading strategies.  Other hypothesis incluses arbitrage oppurtunities on other crypto, however we determine the the exchnge capabilities and the agility of the other traders will quickly elimiinate that arbitrage as well.

The following research tasks were conducted:

    1.  Collect CSV data in a Jupyter notebook file.  
    2.  Prepare the datasets for analysis by cleaning missing and erroneous data.  
    3.  Analyze the data at a high level through summary statistics and visualizations, and use this information to select areas for deeper analysis. Specifically, youâ€™ll select time periods in which to identify arbitrage opportunities.
