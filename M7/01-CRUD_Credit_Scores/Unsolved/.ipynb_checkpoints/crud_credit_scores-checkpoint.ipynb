    "# CRUD Credit Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you’ll use the SQL CRUD statement to build and manipulate tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read `credit_score_info.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame. Review the resulting DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up a new database connection by completing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Create the connection string for your new SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Create the database engine by passing the connection string to the SQLAlchemy `create_engine` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Confirm that the database engine was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the `to_sql` function, create a new table named `credit_score_info` in the database. To do so, use the information that the `credit_score_info_df` DataFrame contains. Be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Include parameters for the engine, the index, and replace the table if it already exists.\n",
    " \n",
    "    - Confirm that the new table exists by calling the `table_names` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a new Pandas DataFrame named `sql_credit_score_info_df` by reading the `credit_score_info` database table. Use the `pd.read_sql_table` function, and pass it the parameters for the table name and the connection. Then confirm that the table was read correctly by reviewing the first five and the last five rows of the resulting DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Note that you need to add a new client to the `credit_score_info` database table. To do so, first write the SQL statement to insert the following information in the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Column names: ‘names’, ‘cities’, ‘credit_score’, and ‘credit_score_provider’.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - New values: ‘Martha Johnson’, ‘Lockport’, 776, and ‘TransUnion’.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once you have created the statement, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Call the `execute` function on the database engine, and pass the variable name that you assigned to the SQL statement as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Read the adjusted `credit_score_info` database table into the `sql_credit_score_info_df` DataFrame using the `pd.read_sql_table` function. Pass it the parameters for the table name and the database connection string (`con=engine`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Confirm that the table has been read correctly by reviewing the last five rows of the resulting DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Write the SQL statement that selects all the columns of data from the `credit_score_info` table, where the credit score is greater than or equal to 750. Then call the `execute` function on the database engine, and review the list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Update a client’s credit score. The client’s name is Stacy Keller, and the new credit score is 810. First, write the SQL statement that updates the `credit_score_info` table. Be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Set the value of the “credit_score” column to 810, where the “names” column reads ‘Stacy Keller’.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Call the `execute` function on the database engine to complete the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To confirm that the update was done correctly, rerun the statement that originally generated the list of clients with credit scores that are greater than or equal to 750.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Review the list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Delete the client named Taylor Turner from the database. First, write the SQL statement that deletes the row where the “names” column equals ‘Taylor Turner’ from the `credit_score_info` table. Be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Call the `execute` function on the database engine to complete the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To confirm that the deletion was done correctly, rerun the query that generated the list of clients with credit scores that are greater than or equal to 750.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Review the list of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Narrow the list of clients to include only those who have credit scores that are greater than or equal to 790. First, write the SQL statement that selects all the columns of data from the `credit_score_info` table, where the credit score is greater than or equal to 790. Be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Call the `execute` function on the database engine to complete the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use the results to create a new Pandas DataFrame named `sql_credit_score_over_790_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Review the new DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Notice that the new `sql_credit_score_over_790_df` DataFrame doesn’t have appropriately named columns. Use the Pandas `columns` function to rename the columns as follows: `['Name', 'City', 'Credit Score', 'Credit Score Provider']`. Then review the updated DataFrame to confirm that the columns are correctly named.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Be aware that your firm’s marketing department will access this list of clients via the firm’s database. So, you need to write the `sql_credit_score_over_790_df` DataFrame to a new database table. Using the `to_sql` function, create a new table named 'sql_credit_score_over_790'. Be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Include parameters for the engine, the index, and replace the table if it already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Confirm that the new table exists by calling the `table_names` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. To confirm that the marketing department can access the `sql_credit_score_over_790` table, use the `pd.read_sql_table` function to visualize the new table. Pass it parameters for the table name and connection (`con=engine`).\n",
